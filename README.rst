Roman adding kata
=================
This is a simple Python kata about adding Roman numbers using string operations.

It is inspired by the description at http://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanCalculator/

It is being used at CamPUG (the Cambridge Python User Group) on Tuesday 7th
March 2017 - see us on meetup.com at https://www.meetup.com/CamPUG/

See the docstring at the top of roman_adding.py for the aim of the kata,
and see test_roman_adding.py for the unit tests.
